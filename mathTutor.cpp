  This will simply display 2 random numbers and ask the user to solve.
  if the user correctly inputs the answer, the program will display thusly.
  IE: "Congratulations, that is correct".
  If incorrect, a message will be displayed for that as well.

  Version 1.0: This will be a simple program that will iterate once, for now, and display corresponding message for correct or incorrect submissions.
  Version 2.0: This will add a lot of functionality, such as:
    -It will provide as many 'problems' as desired by user, using a do while loop
 (?)-It will not only provide the 'incorrect' message, it will also provide a walk through to help them learn faster.
        -Use the %10 in order to get the 1's positions.
        -Use the /10, /100 to get how many 10's and hundreds there are and then *10 or *100 to revert without the 1's/10's present
        -Using all of these methods, can go through the process step by step to show how to do addition of big numbers
