  This will simply display 2 random numbers and ask the user to solve.
  if the user correctly inputs the answer, the program will display thusly.
  IE: "Congratulations, that is correct".
  If incorrect, a message will be displayed for that as well.

  Version 1.0: This will be a simple program that will iterate once, for now, and display corresponding message for correct or incorrect submissions.
  Version 2.0: This will add a lot of functionality, such as:
    -It will provide as many 'problems' as desired by user, using a do while loop
    (?)-It will not only provide the 'incorrect' message, it will also provide a walk through to help them learn faster.
