  A bank charges $10 per month plus the following check fees for a commercial checking account.
  $.10 each for fewer than 20 checks
  $.08 each for 20-39 checks
  $.06 each for 40-59 checks
  $.04 each for 60 or more checks

  The bank also charges an extra $15 if the balance of the acct falls below $400
  (before any check fees are applied). Write a program that asks for the beginning
  balance and the # of checks written.  Compute and display bank's service fees
  for the month.

  Input Validation: Do not accept a negative value for # of checks written.  If
  neg. value is given for the beginning balance, display an urgent msg. indicating
  the acct is overdrawn.
